# Modifications of CxProlog
As required by the GNU General Public License,
this file describes the modifications applied
to CxProlog, in order to create an interface
between Scheme and Prolog. CxProlog was developed
by Artur Miguel Dias from the Universidade Nova
de Lisboa. The modifications done by the maintainers
of the lisp+prolog repository were necessary for
giving logic support to Scheme:

(1) `sxprolog/src/CxProlog.c` -- The definition of `int repl(int i, char *str)` was added to
    the file `sxprolog/src/CxProlog.c`
(2) `sxprolog/src/CmdLine.c` -- The `int split (const char *txt, char delim, char ***tokens)`
    tokenizer was added to `sxprolog/src/CmdLine.c` for spliting messages from Scheme.
(3) `sxprolog/src/CmdLine.c` -- The definition of `void newargs(int n, CharPt *v)` was added
    to the file `sxprolog/src/CmdLine.c` for updating the command line, which Scheme uses to
    send messages to Prolog. A prototype of the `void newargs(int n, CharPt *v)` procedure
    was added to the file `sxprolog/src/CxProlog.c`
(4) `sxprolog/InterLine.c` -- The cursor defined in `static Str InterLineGetLinePrompt(void)`
    was changed from `|: ` to `?- `
(2) The name of the distribution was changed to sxprolog to avoid confusion with the unmodified
    original package.
(3) An interface between Chez Scheme and Prolog was added to the distribution package.
(4) Programs in Java were removed from this distribution, because many firms and Internet
    services do not accept archives with Java content. People who need to work with Java
    must use the original package with the addition of the modified files, together with
    the interfaces `sxprolog/prolog.scm` and `sxprolog/prolog.rkt` that provides
    communication with Chez Scheme and Racket respectively.

## Building the dependencies
All pieces of software discussed in this tutorial are very easy to compile, or have binaries
available: Chez Scheme, Emacs text editor and CxProlog. In the case of CxProlog, the execution
of the line below from a terminal should be sufficient:

```shell

$ make lib
$ cp libcxprolog.so libcxprolog.dylib

```

Be sure that you are inside the ~/sxprolog/ folder. You need to copy `libcxprolog.so` to
`libcxprolog.dylib` only if you are working with a MacIntosh computer and needs to use the
Racket language.

## Test Prolog for Racket
CxProlog for Scheme and Common Lisp does not work on the Racket IDE. I only succeed to make
Racket work on a terminal, at a command line.

```shell
$ racket
Welcome to Racket v7.5.
> (require "prolog.rkt")
> (logic "I am not from here")
CxProlog version 0.98.2 [development]

[main] ?- os_args(X).
X = ['I',am,not,from,here]

[main] ?- halt.
% CxProlog halted.
0
> (logic "She walks in beauty like the night")

[main] ?- os_args(X).
X = ['She',walks,in,beauty,like,the,night]

[main] ?- halt.
% CxProlog halted.
0
> (exit)

$ _
```

In the case of a MacIntosh computer, you will may want to link racket to a call from
`/usr/local/bin` for greater convenience. Here is how to do it:

```shell

$ sudo ln -s /Applications/Racket\ vx.y/bin/racket \
              /usr/local/bin/racket

```

Where vx.y is your version of Racket.

## Test Prolog for Chez Scheme
The foreign language interface of Chez Scheme is quite complex. If I had any influence on
the authors, I would suggest the adoption of a simpler interface, such as the one found in
Racket. Anyway, here is the test of `prolog.scm`:

```shell
â€º scheme
Chez Scheme Version 9.5.3
Copyright 1984-2019 Cisco Systems, Inc.

> (load "chezprolog.scm")
> (logic "She walks in beauty like the night")
CxProlog version 0.98.2 [development]

[main] ?- os_args(X).
X = ['She',walks,in,beauty,like,the,night]

[main] ?- halt.
% CxProlog halted.
0
> (exit)
```

## Common Lisp
For the time being, the only option for Common Lisp is wamcompiler. I already filed an issue on
wamcompiler page. I also asked Lucas and Pedro to create a Common Lisp interface for cxprolog.
