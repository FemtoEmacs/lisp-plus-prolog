   CXPROLOG INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE CODE

 APPLIES TO LINUX, MAC OS X & MINGW/WINDOWS
=============================================



* BUILDING THE APPLICATION

The following command builds the executable CxProlog, with
all the optional features disabled:

    make

 - File generated in LINUX, MAC OS X => cxprolog
 - File generated in MINGW/WINDOWS  => cxprolog.exe



* BUILDING THE DYNAMIC LIBRARY

The following command builds the CxProlog dynamic library, with
all the optional features disabled:

    make lib

 - File generated in LINUX, MAC OS X => libcxprolog.so
 - Files generated in MINGW/WINDOWS  => libcxprolog.a, cxprolog.dll



* ACTIVATING OPTIONAL FEATURES

To activate optional features in the application or in the
dynamic library you supply extra arguments to the "make" command.
The available options are the following:

    JAVA=y
        Adds a JNI-based external interface for Java.

    WXWIDGETS=y
        Adds an external interface for the wxWidgets  platform independent API.

To activate the two options at the same time, you use one of these:

    make JAVA=y WXWIDGETS=y
    make JAVA=y WXWIDGETS=y lib

These features depend on the availability of some libraries and applications.
The dependencies are listed in the section "DEPENDENCIES".



* FULL BUILD

The following command builds the application and the dynamic library
with the three optional features activated:

    make full



* TESTING

The following command checks if CxProlog operates correctly on your machine.
Several unit tests are run in a special CxProlog stress testing mode the exposes
the execution to every opportunity to crash.

    make test



* CLEANING

This removes all the mess created by the compiler, including the application
and the dynamic library:

    make clean



* INSTALLING

The following command installs the CxProlog files in the default
directory "/usr/local" (this may require superuser privileges):

    make install

To compile and install in a different directory, e.g. "/opt/local", use
the 'clean' and the 'PREFIX' options like this:

    make clean install PREFIX=/opt/local



* DEPENDENCIES

The optional features of CxProlog depend on the availability of some libraries
and applications. The dependencies are as follows:

- The GNU readline feature depends on the availability of the
  "libreadline-dev" library. To install on Debian-based systems, the
  command is:

    sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

  To install on Mac OS via MacPorts, the command is:

    sudo port install readline

- The Java interface features depends only on the availability of the Sun JRE,
  but probably you will prefer to install the full Sun JDK.
  To install the JDK on Debian-based systems, the command is:

    sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

- The wxWidgets interface features depends on the availability of the
  "libwxgt-dev" library. To install on Debian-based systems, the command is:

    sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev



Enjoy using CxProlog.

======================================
   MINGW INSTALLATION ON WINDOWS OS
======================================

MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), is a native software port of GCC to
Microsoft Windows, along with a set of import libraries and header files for
the Windows API.

MinGW allows the creation of native Windows applications. MinGW does not
require a compatibility layer DLL. MinGW, always uses direct Win32-API calls.

The latest version of MinGW is always available here:
