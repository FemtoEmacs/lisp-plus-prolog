CXPROLOG INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR WINDOWS
===========================================


* AUTOMATIC PART OF THE INSTALLATION

  You are already running the automatic installer, which is a program
  named CxProlog-<version>.exe.

  After installing, please do not mess with the relative positions of the
  files inside the application folder because those positions are important
  for some features of CxProlog to work, like accessing libraries or
  using the Java services.


* MANUAL PART OF THE INSTALLATION

  - A Java nuisance (sorry...)

    Currently, you need to install a recent version of the Java SE JDK,
    even if you do not intend to use the Java services of CxProlog.
    I hope to be able to eliminate this requirement sometime in a
    future version. Se below how to install the Java SE JDK in your
    system.


  - Manual customization of the console

    You need to customize the console where CxProlog runs to properly
    display non-ANSI characters (e.g. accented characters)! Simply
    select a no-raster font, e.g. Lucida, in the Properties menu of
    the console.


  - Manual installation of Java SE JDK

    For the Java interface to work, you have to install jdk-1.5.0,
    or a newer version, and you need to setup the PATH environment
    variable to make the command 'javac' and the library 'jvm.dll'
    accessible from CxProlog. Please don't move files around; change
    only the PATH variable to include something like this:

"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0/bin;C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.5.0/jre/bin/client"

    Also, beware that CxProlog initializes the Java interface only when
    a Java predicate is called for the first time. So a Java installation
    problem may go unnoticed for sometime. To check if the Java interface
    is working you can use the predicate "java_check/0".



Enjoy using CxProlog.
